# sdl2-quickstart
Set of base SDL2 libraries and cross-referenced Visual Studio 2017 projects for quickly setting up SDL2 applications

<b>Usage</b>

Clone the repository (or download as a zip and extract it, it doesn't matter). The library binaries have all been compiled with Visual Studio 2017 for x86 and x64, but the source is available as well. Simply extract the zipped source folders (for example, the top level of the main SDL library folder would contain the include, lib, and source folders). All Visual Studio projects cross-reference each other using relative paths. No other changes have been made to support compilation using other tools.
